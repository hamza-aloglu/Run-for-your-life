# Rush-for-Your-Life

I created this game with skills that I learned from Unity's "Junior Programmer" course.

The first idea was to make a game where refugees would be attacked by missiles, bullets etc as they rushed to Turkey but I couldn't model it because it was boring so this is the final product.
